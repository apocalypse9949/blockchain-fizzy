Transaction Entry

Users submit transactions to the network as usual.

Transactions enter a pending pool.

Normal Consensus

The blockchain operates with its default consensus (e.g., Multi-Weight PoS) under stable conditions.

Validator influence = combination of stake weight, reputation score, computational contribution, and historical reliability.

Continuous Threat Monitoring

The Threat Detection Layer continuously analyzes:

Unusual block times

Vote inconsistencies

Sudden validator concentration

Double-spend attempts

DDoS patterns

Detection methods may include:

Statistical anomaly detection

ML-based node behavior profiling

Real-time network telemetry

Trigger Event

If abnormal activity is detected:

A “Threat Severity Score” is calculated.

If score crosses a threshold, Adaptive Consensus Shifting is triggered.

Consensus Shape-Shift

The protocol switches to a more secure mode:

Example: Multi-Weight PoS → Hybrid PoS+BFT

Validators’ weights are rebalanced:

Suspicious nodes lose weight.

Trusted nodes gain temporary influence.

If attack vector suggests it, a temporary Proof-of-Work shield can be applied for block finalization.

Survivability Mode

Block times may slow down.

Confirmation requirements may increase.

Priority: Integrity over throughput.

Post-Threat Recovery

After stability returns:

System gradually reverts weights to normal.

Default consensus resumes.
